              <h2 class="display-4">Why network security?</h2>
              <p>First we know everyone now days are on the internet, we shop online, we check our email online, we communicate online, we search online, 
				we socialize online. Almost everything we do are online but we didn't think about the dangers that lurks on the internet. Who will protect us from the 
				dangers? how can we be protected? This is where the network security comes in, It can prevent we from entering dangerous websites, protect our traffic,
 				and protect our data...etc. 
				To understand how we can be protected, we should know what threats there are. There are two types of threats, one is the threats that come in from the 
				network which includes DDoS(Distributed Denial of Service), and network attacks like stack overflow. The other one is threats that came out that is on 
				the network, these includes worms, botnets, network resource thefts...etc. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Protection</h2>
              <p>So we have identified where and how the threats can reach us what's next? Next we start defining ways that protect our network.<br>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
				 <li><b>Positive policy :</b> by having a strong policy that you are expecting  and allows  in your network or denies things that you don't want on your network.</li>
				 <li><b>Firewalls and security zones :</b> firewalls utilizes the policy to separate into zones in the network. This is a great way to filter your traffic.</li> 
				 <li><b>defense in depth :</b> this is a way that you can protect yourself or your data in more layers and secure it.</li>
				 <li><b>intrusion detection :</b> have software that detects unwanted behaviors on your system and stops it.</li>
				 <li><b>quarantine :</b> this can protect your system by placing dangerous files or connections in a confined area.</li>
				 <li><b>reputation :</b> this protects you from entering into networks with known or bad ratings.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>By utilizing all these strategies together in your system and network, we can have a safer and secure internet experience.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Man In the Middle</h2>
              <p>Just as the title suggests, a man in the middle is the third person who is not involved in the exchange of data between two parties and 
				that third person will intercept the data to either get the information, rewrite the data or block the data from being exchanged between the two parties. 
				Man in the middle is a way to attack the network and it can be done through <b>ARP poisoning</b> which is by flooding the network with many ARP responses 
				and then tricks the host into exchanging traffic with you instead of the real address. Another one is <b>TCP hijacking</b>, this is done through three ways 
				of either injecting, deleting or change the packets in the traffic. 
				<br>However, not all man in the middle are bad. A positive reason to have a man in the middle is <b>HTTP Proxy</b> that intercepts all your http traffic and it
 				will check for dangerous hosts, look for strange URLS, detect and remove malicious files before the traffic either goes out or comes into you. 
				<b>Mail Proxy</b> works the same way as HTTP proxy other than it is filtering the mail network.  Another one is <b>SSL man in the middle</b> this utilizing 
				a secure keys, certificates, and encryptions. So it depends on how you use it, man in the middle can be both for bad or for good.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Recon</h2>
              <p> There are two types of reconnaissance meaning the attacker that is performing observation of the network and coming up with a strategy to defeat your network.
 				<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
				   <li><b>Active Reconnaissance :</b> this type of attacker does not know the address so they need to actively seek out the address or a 
						machine that are vulnerable to attacks on the network. </li>
				   <li><b>passive Reconnaissance:</b> This type of attacker is on the network and they have access to the data on the network, they can study
 						and learn of the data that is on the network.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>To defend against these recons we can develop a stronger policy, physically secure the network hardware, use log-correlation of IPS, SIEM or firewalls and use honeynets
 				to slow down the attacker.	</p>

              <p>"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send"<br> 
				This is a very interesting concept introduced, it wants us to understand that the internet can be filled with many unknown errors either
 				unintentional or intentionally designed. However, we should design software that can be prepared to handle those errors. The last concept wants us to be 
				careful of the stuff we send because the other hosts can have bad software that make it prone to exploits so we should have software that for example 
				encrypts your data before leaving your system. </p>

              <p>In conclusion for this week I feel like I have learned more in-depth of what it takes to really secure the network, how the software in the
 				system and the network help protect our traffic. Especially the robustness principle is a very simple line, however, it is a lot to take in and think about
 				and how that have shaped the design of our modern day network security. The lab exercises are very interesting to help me understand more about how to look
 				at the packet data. Overall, this lecture is very informative and really broadens my understanding of what it takes to have a secure network.</p>
