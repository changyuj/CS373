              <p>Mobile devices have gone a long way from 1973’s first handheld mobile phone made by Motorola to modern smartphones 
			  with capability of text messaging, browse internet, and having variety of apps and services. First cell phones does 
			  not have too much capability in term of their architecture design and their programming, other than a basic calling 
			  and receiving and some special keys like <i>Pwr, Snd, Clr, Rcl, Sto, Fcn, Vol, Lock and End</i>. These are functions 
			  like power, send, clear, receive, and stop…etc. Modern day mobile phones are now very advanced and smart that the 
			  design is much more complicated and allows new design of user interface that is easy to use which in term opens up 
			  possibilities of finding bugs and vulnerability in the system by the bad guys. Because of the new system with addition 
			  of functions that allows scrips like java or apps that bad guys can use to create malicious scrips or fake malicious 
			  apps that can run on the smartphone and infect the system. </p>

              <p>Mobile devices evolved from 1G in the 80’s with Analog to 2G in the 90’s with digital to 2.5G in the 2000’s with 
			  data service then to 3G in the 2001 with internet services and then now with 4G of VoIP. 
				With each evolution more services and different bands are needed to support them. <br>
				There are a few different mobile operating systems in the early days but now day’s smartphone are mainly Android or
				Apple iOS. The apple iOS provided closed source so there is no custom rom and it is only in apple devices. IOS is
				fully integrated with apple services they provide themselves like the iCloud, App store, Siri, iTunes, facetime…etc.
				are all limited to only apple devices. Whereas, Android is provided by Google and it is free and mostly open source 
				so there are many mobile developers that can create custom roms and custom android systems that fit their purpose.
				It is also because of this that malware developers are able to find bugs and vulnerability in the system to create 
				malware to infect the system. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Mobile Danger </h2>
              <p>Just like the evolution of mobile devices, the malware developers are evolving their attacks on mobile devices as 
			  well from using Bluetooth to pretending to format the memory to stealing information’s on smartphones. As the operating 
			  systems of smartphones become more advanced and including more services, bad guys found more ways to send malware to 
			  infect the phone. They can be infected through opening URL that are sent by sms or downloading and installing fake apps 
			  or apps that are repackaged with malicious codes. Intentions of mobile malware can be setup botnet, stealing sensitive 
			  information, or monetary gains like stealing bank information since many banks have 2-step verification that will send 
			  you a code to confirm your transactions and this is where the attackers will want to get the information in the 
			  background without user knowing and access their personal bank and steal their money. Luckily as mobile devices gets 
			  more advanced, the developers are also increasing their security features in the mobile as well.   </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Tools</h2>
              <p>There are some tools that can help in analysis of mobile malwares, specifically android malwares since android is 
			  open source and we can see its apk files. Some of the tools that are used are:<br>
			  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
			  <li><b>Android SDK manager : </b>This is an android development tool for developing apps</li>
			  <li><b>APKTool : </b>used to decode recources and get smali code</li>
			  <li><b>Smali  : </b>This is an android development tool for developing apps</li>
			  <li><b>Baksmali : </b>This is an disassembler for the . dex which is dalvik executable format</li>
			  <li><b>dex2jar tool  : </b>this is used to covert .dex into  .jar format</li>
			  <li><b>JD-GUI  : </b>this tool is used to decompile the .jar format</li>
			  </ul><br>
			  The above are only a small list of tools that were introduced in the lecture and used to provide us a quick overview of 
			  how to use those tools to analyze malicious apks.

              <h2 class="display-4">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>In conclusion for this week the lecture started from the basic evolution of cell phones that we are all very familiar
			  with now days and then goes deeper into the architecture of the design of modern smartphones. By understanding how the 
			  modern smartphones are designed we get a little insight into how and where there can be a bug or vulnerability that the
			  bad guys can attack and gain control. Next the lecture went into what and how the smarphones are infected by the malwares
			  and what is it's purpose...etc. The lab also provided a nice hands on practice to help us understand how those malware works
			  and how to find them in the phone. I think overwall this week's lecture helped me understand how to be more secure on my own
			  mobile devices.</p>
