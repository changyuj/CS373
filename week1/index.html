              <h2 class="display-4">Malware Basics</h2>
              <p>From the video lecture, I have learned the definition of malware is a malicious software that is used to carry out unwanted behavior to a computer system. When we further analyze it, we can find out there the motives that drives these malware creations can be either destruction, spy, political gain or financial gains.</p>
			  <p>Through the research of malwares, they can be classified into Viruses, Trojans, and Potentially Unwanted Programs. 
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><b>Virus:</b> These are files that are executable and are usually triggered when we run the program. (ie. running an downloaded infected program).</li>
				<li><b>Worm:</b> These are types that will spread itself as fast as possible with no user interaction. (ie. replication of the program in the background).</li>
				<li><b>Trojan:</b> These types will usually be hidden inside known file types that the user are familiar with (ie. word doc, excel, PDF… etc). These programs will find a vulnerability in your system and install a backdoor that will allow the intruder to gain access to your system at anytime.</li>
				<li><b>PUP, PUA, PUS:</b> unwanted programs includes adwares, spywares and some harmful or intruding tools</li>
				</ul>

              <h2 class="display-4">How malwares work</h2>
              <p>In order for anyone to protect themselves against any malicious software, we would need to understand how the malwares work. The easiest way to understand how the malwares work is by tracing back to how the system get infected in the first place and understand what vectors are used to infect the system. Common vectors are file types that users are familiar with so they will drop their guard and open up the file like the office files, PDF and emails. Other vector can be from unofficial downloads of apps and programs that user try to get for free and the apps and program can be altered without our knowledge. Another vector can be the use of USB sticks that does not belong to you and maybe tempered with. Common vector is internet, where user goes to unsecure or unsafe websites that are compromised. By understanding how these malwares are spread now gives us a fighting chance to protecting ourselves thanks to the antivirus research. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Malware research</h2>
              <p>Thanks to top researchers and antivirus companies out there that are working around the clock studying and developing ways to crack the malwares and help keeping our system clean. They are like the doctors who prescribe medicines when we are sick and give us vaccination shots to prevent us from getting sick if the virus is seen again. </p>
			  <p>Malware researchers obtain the infected files and call them samples and keep them contained in an ‘inactive’ state so they are safe to be transported to other systems for studying. To study the samples, they would either study the code <b>(static analysis)</b> or have very strict environment of systems that are under their control and watch how the malware works<b>(dynamic analysis></b>. Understanding what its purpose is a key to defeating it. Researchers will have to use multiple analytic tools to help them dissect the malware and find out where it is going, what it is hiding and what did it do. Some of these tools are provided to us to use in our labs like process explorer, process monitor, flypaper, and antispy…etc. </p>
			  <p>In addition, the malware threats are classified into three major categories. 
			  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			    <li><b>Advanced –</b> These attacker are professionals that can make their own exploits and experienced in intrusion of systems.</li>
				<li><b>APersistent –</b> these attackers have an target that they will work to get that target reached undetected.</li>
				<li><b>Threat –</b> these attacker are the most dangerous since they are organized and will funded and are motivated by some purpose.</li>
			   </ul>

              <h2 class="display-4">Week 1 Lab</h2>
              <p>In this week, we have a lab that get us a taste of how malware researchers study and analyze the malware <b>(dynamic analysis)</b>. First we are given access to virtual machines that are isolated and before we start anything, always take a snapshot of the system because this is where you can always go back to when you lose control of the malware or you need to exam the action of the malware again from the beginning. The before mentioned tools are provided to us and we must run them first before running the malware sample. 
We used <b>FlyPaper</b> to stop program from exiting and block network. <b>FakeNet</b>, as the name suggests, set up a fake network protocol that will capture network requests. <b>ProcessMonitor</b> that shows us a log of timestamped program execution steps in the system. This is very useful to trace the program to see what it has done. <b>ProcessExplorer</b> is very similar to task manager that will show us the process that are executed on the system. <b>AntiSpy</b> provided many great features for us to investigate system files, system registry and properties. <b>FileInsight</b> is a hex editor that is great to look at the binary code of the malware that can help use decrypt the file.
 Another great tool to use is to calculate the MD5 hash or the SHA1 hash of the target file and to make sure a file is official or has it been tempered with by checking it against virustotal's file bank.

              <h2 class="display-4">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>In conclusion, I feel like first week was presented with many new insights into how our systems are compromised and more importantly, learning more about malwares and having VM to allow us hands on lab and work on samples. Learning to use all the new tools and understanding what evil.exe is doing. Collaborating with classmates in piazza forum allows us to help each other troubleshoot, answer questions and share findings. An interesting blog that is shared by classmate is the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/2013/03/19/analysis-of-chinese-attack-against-korean-banks" target="_blank">Analysis of chinese attack against korean banks. </a> It describes exact steps and functions of the same process we have seen in our lab 1 sample. 
Overall, I am very excited to see what else I will be learning regarding malwares and how to protect myself against them.
