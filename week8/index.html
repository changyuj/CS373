              <p>Spam is something we receive a lot in our emails, especially now the digital mailing is so popular. But not all 
			  mails we receive are from friends or relative or some people we know, there are many unwanted and harmful mails as 
			  well that will try to trick and lure us into opening that message, click on some malicious link or download malicious
			  attachments. So having a way to filter out the unwanted emails and only keep the emails that is safe is a very 
			  important feature that that can protect us from harmful mails.</p>

              <p>Services providers’ uses retired emails or sets up a new emails that on legitimate emails would go into those 
			  mailbox, it is to capture and collect spam mails. These are called <b>Honeypots or Spamtrap</b>. They can also 
			  use the domain or recipient in those mails to set them as a spam and further use them to help filter our customer’s
			  mailbox. <b>Botnet</b> is a series of machines that have been taken over to support a goal that the end user of those
			  machines does not support and not aware of as well. They can be used to send out spamming mails and attacks. 
			  <b>Snowshoe spam</b> is a spamming technique that is used to spread out the IP used to send out spam so it will be
			  hard for the anti-spam vendors to track down single IP that is sending spam and block it. <b>Phishing</b> emails are
			  mails that try to get you to input information and steal your information from the user whereas the spam emails are
			  unwanted advertisements or mails that users receive without subscribing to them.

              <h2 class="display-4">Fight Back Against Spam</h2>
              <p>So how would we fight back against spam? There are different techniques and aspects we can look for in the mail: <br>
			  Reputation-driven: <br>
			  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
			  <li><b>IP : </b>We can look at the IP of the sender and see its reputation and see if it is on the block list.</li>
			  <li><b>Message : </b>We can look at the message itself to look for spam clues.</li>
			  <li><b>URL : </b>We can look for urls in the email if it points to malicious sites.</li>
			  </ul><br>
			   Content-driven: <br>
			  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
			  <li><b>Common string : </b>we can look for common spam words used and use that as a filter.</li>
			  <li><b>Fixed strings vs Variable Strings : </b>we can look for the way those string are used if the spammer try to use 
			  different string to get away with string catching filter by using variables or special chars.</li>
			  <li><b>Message attributes : </b>we can look at the message to see if there is images and urls that give us hints for spam.</li>
			  <li><b>combinations of string and attributes : </b>we can combine both looking for both spam words and attributes in the message to further accurately filter the spam.</li>
			  </ul><br>

              <h2 class="display-4">Tools </h2>
              <p>There are some tools that the researchers use to help classify spam mails for example by using <b>DIG</b> 
			  (Domain information grouper) this is a linux tool that is used to investigate the DNS records and by knowing the
			  DNS we can see if that domain have record of sending spam mails. Another one is <b>WHOIS </b>which another tool that 
			  is used to look up the domain and IP registration information and by knowing this, we can look up if they have bad
			  reputation or on the block list…etc.<br>
				In the lecture we learned to use <b>Regex Coach </b>which is a tool that allows us to write our own regular expression syntax and 
				function learning to filter out spam strings. Most of the regular expression are written by humans since it has not been developed
				to automated like the YARA rules. However, since this regex is written manually, the person writing the syntax needs to be careful
				not to write rules that would block out normal or safe mails as well. The <b>Trustedsource.org and Spamhaus.org</b>
				are two big database that can be used to look for reputations of the mail.</p>

              <p>In conclusion for this week the lecture have expanded my understand of spam emails, not only are they unwanted but they can actually be useful to help identify future
			  spam mails if we apply the techniques we have learned in the lecture to classify them and learn more about them. My biggest profit from this lecture is learning to use
			  the Regex Coach tool to write the expressions to match certain variations of unwanted spam mail string. Overall, I learned how to look for details, hints and key aspects
			  of identifying if the email is a spam or phishing email in my inbox.</p>
