              <p>As the internet gets popular for all users, companies and organizations, there needs a way for everyone to access the internet or deliver the 
			  contents to its users. The websites becomes the main source of destination that most groups utilizes to deliver this content and it is because of 
			  these website that become the primary target for people with malicious intents to target it and deliver their threats. We know the web attacks targets 
			  the <b>users</b> of the web and the <b>browsers and plugin</b>. We know that even with the most advanced defense software or the most secure system 
			  in place, the user will always be the vulnerable victims because the attackers can disguise the website or place attracting words and images that lures
			  the user into clicking the advertisement or going into attacker controlled malicious websites. The web filled with good contents and bad are all mixed
			   together and available to all users in the world wide web, this makes it easy for the bad guys to target anyone on the web.</p>

              <p>The web as we know it now days are HTTP and HTML. HTTP is the foundation of data communication and transmission on the internet. The first browsing 
			  software is called <b>Mosaic</b>, it is the first internet information browser for the World Wide Web. Mosaic is developed by the University of Illinois
			  National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The history or key layer of the internet can be summarized into 7 categories: <br>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
				 <li><b>Computers :</b> first personal computing system of apple by jobs & Wozniak in 1976.</li>
				 <li><b>Networks :</b> In 1973 Ethernet was added but was mainly for mainframe.</li> 
				 <li><b>Internet :</b> TCP/IP was added in 1975.</li>
				 <li><b>World Wide Web  :</b> started in 1990 with http://.</li>
				 <li><b>Browsers :</b> The first browser Mosaic in 1993.</li>
				 <li><b>Search Engine :</b> around before 1998 but google changed the way users search and use the internet.</li>
				 <li><b>Content :</b> in .html to deliver the web content information.</li>

              <p>The web became the target for attackers to deliver malicious files since 1994, about 95% of the malwares are delivered through the web now days. There are 4 
			  evolution age for malware delivery.<br>
			  <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
			  <li><b>Stone Age : </b>with generic phishing, popup redirections, script bombing.</li>
			  <li><b>Bronze Age : </b>improved phishing, cross site scripting, browser exploits.</li>
			  <li><b>Iron Age : </b>spear phishing, plug-in exploits, custom browser exploits.</li>
			  <li><b>Present : </b>Man in the middle browser, html5 based attack, advanced spear phishing.</li>
			  </ul><br>
			  There are different points where the attacker can exploit and deliver their malicious software. In the <b>HTTP</b> layer, they can exploit the http proxy or 
			  network layer on the host. In the <b>HTML</b> layer specifically the Raw HTML, attacker can intercept traffic using winlnet software. In the <b>HTML</b> layer 
			  specifically the DOM tree, attacker would attack through the browser directly or through the extensions in the browser. In the <b>JavaScript</b> layer, attacker 
			  can attack through the script engine by modifying the script that goes in and out of the internet explorer. In the <b>De-obfuscated Content</b> layer, attacker will 
			  use java scripting, packing to elude the user from seeing what is actually going on in the background.</p>

              <p>Users of the web are the weakest link because they can be attacked or lured to attacker’s trap easily through understanding internet user’s common traits like
			  <b>Impatient, Laziness, Self-proclaimed omniscience, clickaholic.</b> These traits causes the user to be vulnerable to attacker designed traps like a web claiming 
			  to speed up your pc, providing free file, clicking on ads…etc. The attacker uses these known user exploits to direct us into their web with malicious contents that 
			  we actually go to ourselves. The malicious contents may download executables, contain browser exploits or malicious forms that trick us into entering important 
			  information. </p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Web Security</h2>
              <p>So to protect ourselves from the web attacks, there are a few things we can do. First thing is to check the URL or the website we are going to visit and check for 
			  its reputation, if they have high or good reputation it would give you a sense of positive and trustable security regarding visitation of that site. We can also check
			  the site certification services that some sites would have compliance and trusted certificates. Client and gateway anti-virus or anti-malwares may try to stop you from
			  visiting the known or unsafe websites but it would still be up to the user if they really want to click on it and visit at their own risk. Safe URL shorteners, try to be
			  smart and look at the actual redirect or the actual address that the URL is pointing to let the user known if the link is safe or not. The web content provider can educate 
			  their customers regarding phishing victims ie. Bank websites. And lastly has to be the end user education, in the end it would all come down to the user if they are educated 
			  with enough web security knowledge that they know how to identify which site is safe and which is not to visit. </p>

              <p>In conclusion for this week I feel like I have learned about the web layers and structures and how the danger can be presented in the world wide web. 
			  Not only have I learned how the attackers can reach their targets through different methods in the web, I have also learned how we can avoid these dangerous 
			  websites by doing some checking on the authenticity of those sites we are going to visit as well as not being lured into clicking unknown links or advertisements.
			   In all, I feel like the most important lesson I have learned is that the user is the weakest link here so if we can control ourselves by not going to unknown sites,
			   download unknown files, and click on unknown ads, then we should be able to surf the web safely and not fall for any malicious attacks.</p>
